## Game mechanics

With 3 Axies in your account you get a total of **20 daily energy.** The ultimate goal when consuming these is to gain **Smooth Love Potion. (SLP)** This is the secondary currency in the entire Axie Infinity ecosystem and is ultimately the resource you'll be farming when playing the game.  
![img of energy cap per n\_axies](https://i.imgur.com/a0M1Ib0.png)  
There are **2 types** of energy here which causes a lot of confusion for beginners, let's name them for posterity:  
   - First one's the daily energy cap mentioned above. let's call this **denergy.** This number can be seen at the top left of the main menu. It is denoted by a lightning icon.
   - Second one's consumed in-game when casting your Axies' ability cards. This will simply be called **energy.** This is visible at the numerator at the bottom left when playing Adventure or Arena, capped at **10.**
![img of energy](https://i.imgur.com/CzedSNx.png)  
At the time of writing, only **Daily Quests** are available. This can be viewed by clicking the "quests" icon near the top center of the main menu.  
![img of daily quests](https://i.imgur.com/ZcIWixd.png)
![img of daily quests](https://i.imgur.com/sXbIHKV.png)  
Suffice to say, the very basic goal of every player is to _complete all three in this list every day._ However, there are very different ways to go about it and all of those involve mindful allocation of your _denergy._ In the game's current state, you can _consume_ **denergy** in either **Adventure** or **Arena.**

### **Adventure**

Every single day you'll have a chance to earn a _maximum_ of **50 SLP** in Adventure Mode as shown in the fraction on the center left of the screen. You can still play Adventure levels even after winning all 50 available SLP. This is still a viable move if you've still got _denergy_ left since wins past the 50 daily cap will still reward experience points to your Axies. Playing Adventure _without denergy rewards nothing._ Conversely, clearing more difficult ruins, rewards a lot more SLP.  
![ruin map](https://i.imgur.com/PtZUatI.png)  
Beating a Ruin rewards equal amounts of experience points (exp) for _all_ the Axies used. It doesn't matter if an Axie gets knocked out before the Ruin is cleared. It will still gain exp, again, as long as you cleared the ruin with **denergy** remaining. You're defeated when _all_ your Axies are knocked out. A defeat here will _**not**_ subtract **denergy** so you're free to attempt a difficult ruin multiple times. However there's a more efficient way to proceed. More on this later. The table below outlines the different outcomes when you play Adventure.  
| denergy left? | Result | Consumed | 50 Cap Reached? | Reward   |
|---------------|--------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| Yes           | Win    | denergy  | No              | Exp, SLP |
| Yes           | Win    | denergy  | Yes             | Exp      |
| Yes           | Lose   | none     | No              | None     |
| No            | Lose   | none     | Yes             | None     |

Axies have their own hit points or hp written on the left of their health bar hovering above them. If this number's depleted your Axie will end up knocked out or will go into **Last Stand.**  
![last stand](https://i.imgur.com/MwcSTOU.png)  

![ruin 20](https://i.imgur.com/s6Ct7KX.png)  
One of your "end game" goals as a player is to reduce the amount of time and effort you'd be spending on Adventure to the point where it's almost an afterthought. To get to that point it's necessary to level up your Axies sufficiently that you're able to spam a high level ruin, preferrably **Ruin 20.** This nets you the 50 SLP cap in as few games as possible.

The grind to high level ruins will be tedious. The earlier ruins reward only _2 SLP per clear_ if it rewards anything at all. Still, the allocation of time and energy is entirely the player's discretion. However, I'd like to paint a picture of the convenience afforded by leveling up your Axies. My three level 20+ Axies are able to **clear ruin 20 five times in fifteen minutes with each clear rewarding a minimum of 11 SLP.** I would then spam **Ruin 1** for the remainder of the required clears to fulfill the "Complete 10 Adventure Levels" daily quest. All 50 of my daily SLP cap is gained in under 20 minutes.  

All things considered, the yield from Adventure pales in comparison with that from the Arena.

###  **Arena**
This is where the bulk of your **SLP** will _eventually_ come from. Eventually being the operative word since **Sky Mavis** implemented sweeping changes in the game's SLP rewards structure. You are heavily incentivized to climb the leaderboard to increase your **Matchmaking Rating (MMR)**. To view your **MMR** click/tap the trophy icon near the bottom right of the main menu.  
![matchmaking rank](https://i.imgur.com/G8EGI5F.png)  
Every player starts at **1200 MMR** on a new account. At the time of writing, every win at this MMR rewards **6 SLP.** The higher your MMR the higher the SLP you'd gain per win. So far, there exists no official document regarding the SLP reward progression in the Arena. The following is the "bracket" or "tier" system aggregated by players referencing their own MMR progression.  
![arena round 1](https://i.imgur.com/JqTACLp.png)  
All Arena games are 1v1 between two human players. Both players start with **3 energy** and **6 cards.** These cards are distributed across your team of three Axies. In succeeding rounds, both players are guaranteed to **draw 3 three cards** across the _remaining Axies_ on the battle field. This means you _cannot draw cards for your Axies that are already knocked out._ Conversely, all _unplayed cards_ from the knocked Axies will be discarded so you've got to consider when to play or when not to play cards from Axies at risk of getting knocked.  
![img of knocked Axie](https://i.imgur.com/S9bmRya.png)  
The game boils down to a **turn-based card game** and the order of Axies are predetermined before the cards are played out. Notice the bar at the top of the screen. There are pictures of the Axies still in play with large white numbers beside them. The order is determined by the **speed** attribute of all the Axies in the battlefield. In case of a speed tie, the Axie that has **fewer hit points (hp) goes first.** Finally if hit points are still tied, the Axie with a **lower ID number goes first.** Summarily, it's (1) Speed, (2) HP, (3) ID.  
| MMR | 799 | 800 | 1000 | 1200 | 1300 | 1500 | 1800 | 2000 | 2300 |
|-----|-----|-----|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| SLP | 0   | 1   | 3    | 6    | 9    | 12   | 15   | 18   | 21   |

The overarching goal of all players is to win as many Arena matches _consuming denergy in the process._ However, unlike Adventure, there's still great merit to playing Arena despite having 0 denergy. The only way to get familiar, get decent, and eventually get better at the Arena is to play the game as much as you can. Even if you _do not gain SLP for Arena wins without denergy left_ you'll still gain actual experience from facing other players, with all sorts of team compositions. At the end of the day spending denergy is a balancing act especially for newer players. You basically invest _denergy_ in Adventure during the first few weeks so you'd eventually be able to clear Adventure levels with absolute ease which, in turn, allows you to allocate _all of your denergy_ in the Arena. We will pave the road to your Axie Infinity progression in the next section.

## Blueprint
We're huge suckers for data so a little bit of data entry is at hand. Below is a snap of our very own SLP progression sheet. The monthly metrics only represent 21 days in August because we started tracking late.  
![img of google sheet](https://i.imgur.com/NyTCQyW.png)  
We won't require you to monitor your progress in such high resolution (But if you're inclined, just say the word and we'll make a similar tracker for you). We only want you to keep track of the following things on a **daily basis:**  
1. SLP gained
2. Number of Arena Matches
3. Number of Arena Wins
4. End-of-Day MMR  

This is a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12fGxOUyM1URLDxPLIVFhDiCJExj1A9XsmEID8DjGqQQ/edit?usp=sharing) to a shared google sheet where you'll fill those out.

### Week 1
Day 1-3: **Spend 20 denergy on Adventure** then play as many Arena matches as you can until you complete the **five Arena wins.** If possible play Arena _beyond the daily quests' 5-win requirement._ Your primary goal in these Arena matches is to form a deep understanding of game fundamentals:
- The arrangement of Axies on the battlefield
- The order of cards you're playing on each of your Axies
- Your own cards' damage numbers on opposing Axies

Day 4-7: **Spend 10 denergy _each_ on Adventure and Arena.** Do not concern yourself about MMR loss just yet. You're piloting a fairly competitive team so you're bound to climb when you've improved enough. For now your primary goal will be **correctly keeping track of your opponent's energy.** I cannot stress this enough. As far as I'm concerned energy counting is the ticket to entering the 2,000 MMR range. That's the range where you'll start to really cash in especially since your "share upgrade" will kick in when you break the 2k MMR barrier. More on this later.  
### Week 2
![img of adventure map](https://i.imgur.com/PtZUatI.png)  
Day 8-10: **Spend 20 denergy on Adventure** and play _at least 10 Arena matches._ If you didn't get your 5 wins in those 10 Arena matches, don't sweat it. Take a break and resume when you're ready. There exists unlucky spells where it feels like you can't draw the cards you need or all the critical strikes in the world's hitting you. There's a fair bit of luck involved but don't let your misfortune get in the way of keeping true to your energy counting fundamentals. On the adventure side of things you're probably farming at Ruin 9 or Ruin 11 at this point. Ruin 12 is a difficult one. However, in line with the goal of making Adventure as simple as possible, you ought to continue working towards reaching Ruin 20. First you've got to break out of Ruin 12, then farm Ruin 14. This is why you're spending 20 denergy on Adventure for around three days.  
![rock paper scissors](https://i.imgur.com/ZZywVzc.png)  
Day 11-14: **Spend 15 denergy on Arena and 5 denergy on Adventure.** At this point, you're getting used to counting your opponent's energy. That is still your primary concern. Your secondary goal now is to memorize your cards' damage numbers on different classes of opposing Axies. You've probably encountered instances where you fell short of knocking out an Axie by just a few hit points or spent way too much energy trying to knock an opposing Axie. Knowing your own damage numbers against different classes is yet another thing that sets players apart.

### Week 3
Day 15-30: **Day 15 is both payout day and performance review day.** By this time we'd have collected fourteen data points for reference. We'd be conducting the performance review after you get your share of the SLP or whichever currency you opted for. More on payout options later. This is a chance for both parties to give each other feedback. If you feel like we haven't been satisfactory managers for any reason you might have then you can simply walk away, of course, with your complete share in hand. Conversely, all we'd do is reference the sheet we asked you to fill out to assess your performance. We're fully aware of the growing pains coming from knowing absolutely nothing about the game so it's wildly inconsiderate to expect your gains to match ours. To be blunt, if you followed the given the blueprint provided thus far, we already know the bare minimum of what your 2-week SLP yield will be. Numbers would be discussed later.

If we both agree to continue this scholarship then, henceforth, denergy expenditure will be **Scholar's discretion.** Suffice to say, at the bare minimum you'd still have to complete every single daily quest for rest of your play. If anything, just let two objectives guide your play moving forward:
1. **Adventure efficiency** where you spend the least amount of time earning the most amount of SLP.
2. **Arena Improvement** where you spend the most amount of time to _be better_ earning as much SLP as you can.

## Gains and Payout

SLP is a cryptocurrency token based off of the Ethereum blockchain. Enough of the pretentious jargon. In layman's terms, SLP is expensive to move around because the network at which it's riding on is, in the grand scheme of things, still in its infancy. Early technology is expensive.

Note that funds from new Ronin wallets cannot be taken out of the account for the first fourteen days. Because of this we can only provide Option 2 for a brand new Scholar account. All three options are available from the second week onwards.

1. Transfer from Ronin wallet (the account that contains the Axies and SLPs) to a Metamask wallet of your choice. Suffice to say this requires the scholar to have a Metamask account. When transferring SLP, the receiving Metamask account will be charged a variable gas fee. This changes because the network load on the Ethereum blockchain changes. This is probably the most expensive option. The upside to this method is you get the actual token so you can exchange it for a dollar or peso amount at the time of your choosing. This brings me to the second option.
![ronin chain withdrawal](https://i.imgur.com/ciHDoF2.png)  
2. You can opt to cash out the equivalent peso amount as shown in [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/smooth-love-potion/php). We will conduct a local transfer with any of the following channels: **(1) G-Cash (2) InstaPay (3) Bank Transfer**. Note that this option is time sensitive because the price of SLP is liable to change rapidly. We have to agree upon a price and the corresponding amount due shall be in your account within the next thirty seconds. In the event of a failed transaction, i.e., connectivity issues, nonresponsive payment portal, unscheduled maintenance, we'd have to re-quote. This re-quote is necessary since option two completely removes your gas expense from the equation so, at the very least, you shall receive the most up-to-date conversion rate.
![coingecko conversion rate](https://i.imgur.com/kYr6aAD.png)  
3. Final option is to skip a Metamask wallet and go straight through Binance. This requires a Binance account from the scholar since this account's address will be the address your share of the SLP will be transferred to. More information is needed in this process since it's a very recently added means to "cash out."  

The following outlines the specifics of the scholar's payout.
1. We start on a **50/50 split** for the SLP gains.
2. **By default** this will be paid out on a **weekly basis.**
   - A week for you starts on the very first day of play. This will also be your **"payday"** moving forward.
   - You will be able to claim your share every seven days since you first began playing.
   - Claiming can only be done after daily quest completion
   - When you opt for the second option, we will settle on an agreed upon time of day to conduct the fund transfer. This will be the default schedule moving forward.
3. Your share will be **upgraded to 60%** when you meet the following conditions:  
   a) Average **200 SLP for the week.**  
   b) Reach 2,000 MMR  
   - If you reached 2,000 MMR before payday, immediately reach out so we can check your rating on the leaderboard. Come payday, your MMR should not be under 1,950 in order to claim the **60% upgrade**

There are two currencies or, more accurately, **Tokens** in Axie Infinity. First is the already discussed **SLP** and the other one's **AXS.** The latter is a more precious and more expensive (approximately 80 USD each as of writing) resource given that the only way to earn AXS is to buy one on an exchange or compete with the best players in the world.  
![arena rewards](https://i.imgur.com/h0973fN.png)  

Only the top 1,000 players in the leaderboard get rewarded AXS. In the event that you're able to secure a spot for an AXS reward, we're taking a 20% share and the rest is yours. This is on top of the new tier of **SLP** profit sharing you've unlocked by breaking 2,000 MMR. There is truly no argument about where the sizeable gains come from, hence, my constant emphasis on improving your Arena gameplay.

## Principles
We'd like to bookend this document by saying that this kind of progression over four weeks of playing the game _consistently_ is very doable. Please scroll back up to check the MMR at which all of this data gathering started. The blueprint laid out above didn't come out of thin air. This document in its entirety is a result of about a month of data gathering and research. The image below shows our rather modest metrics just five days into September 2021.  
![img of 2000 MMR](https://i.imgur.com/ic3KHkm.png)  
Our current average MMR is a long way up from the very first data point of 1296 and this isn't even a month into it. This is the reason why the 60% share upgrade is structured like so. Those two conditions are practically co-dependent. It's difficult to reach this MMR while falling short of that SLP yield.

In light of all of those, the principle behind this document is to facilitate your growth using what _objectively_ worked. None of the instructions above involve guesswork. It goes without saying but we believe you shouldn't push yourself harder than you can handle since that might end up impeding your progress. The kind of progression outlined above involved a maximum of three hours of play time per day and those days are few and far between.  

Let us conclude this with a quick estimate of how much you're due when you finally earned the 60% upgrade. You'll eventually play the game for just about two hours each day. This translates to **840 SLP for 14 hours of work each week.** That duration isn't even two full workdays. If the price of SLP stays where it is at the time of writing then your account's getting the equivalent of 6720 Php per week. It may not be anything to write home about but, again, that's what you gained from a 14-hour work week. The only travesty here is how we're not (yet) able to manage 60-energy accounts.
